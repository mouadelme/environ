## My Contributions
This project was a semester long project for an Advanced Software Development class at the University of Virginia in the Spring of 2024. We worked in groups of five with each team member having a unique role. Agile software development techniques were used in this class, specifically Scrum. My team role was Scrum Master and I was responsible for documenting all team progress throughout each sprint, keeping track of project backlog and spring backlogs, updating GitHub Issues as necessary, and organizing team meetings.
During this project, I used a combination of Django, Python, and HTML to add features to the website such as deleting a form, error handling, URL redirects and invalid URL handling.
